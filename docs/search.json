    "text": "Introduction and Data\nMotivation and Context\nThe motivation for this project stemmed from the measles dataset from tidytuesday. It was interesting to see how the data set categorically characterized the data. Our team imported the data into R and used the categories as a guide to make our plots and questions. The data as reported in the Wall Street Journal presents a map of measles vaccination rates in schools across the United States, showing that some schools have dangerously low vaccination rates, which increases the risk of measles outbreaks. The data is based on information from the 2018-2019 school year and includes public, private, and charter schools. According to the map, many of the schools with the lowest vaccination rates are in states such as Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and Oregon. The article also notes that measles cases have been on the rise in recent years, and emphasizes the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the highly contagious virus. Through this narrative and viewing the raw data we were able to form our hypothesis and question.\nResearch question: In 2018, how does the vaccination rate for measles differ across regions in the US? How do school districts in regions with high vaccination rates vs. low vaccination rates differ (public v. private, enrollment statistics, type of geographical region - urban, rural)?\nHypothesis: It is expected that states with higher rates of urbanization will have higher vaccination rates for mmr. It is also expected that schools in these states will have higher vaccination rates, differing mainly on whether they are private or public (whereby private may have higher rates).\nNote:\nWe saw negative values, but we don’t know what it means - perhaps these suggest that the schools did/do not report vaccination rates.\nFull disclosure: In the first visualization, there are some data points in Asia, suggesting that some of the schools are located in Asia, but we are working on removing these. Also, for now the first visualization has “eval: FALSE” to facilitate pushing and pulling on GitHub (leaflet takes up a lot of space).\nEthical Issues\nVaccination data is listed under HIPAA as protected health information and therefore cannot be shared without patient consent. In certain areas, vaccine data is not required for schools as well. The data may also be used to discriminate against certain areas unjustly. The US does not all benefit equally from our research. Some areas may also be more or less receptive to revealing their vaccination information so the study may not impact our target population equally.\nLimitations\nSome states do not require schools to report MMR vaccination data, thus resulting in a lack of information for a few states. This results in inconclusive data from those states, and they will not be considered for this research analysis.\nCiting Sources\n[1] “Urban Percentage of the Population for States, Historical.” Iowa State University | Iowa Community Indicators Program, Iowa State University, www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/urban-pct-states."

    "text": "Results\nFigure 1 - This visualization answers the 1st research question by showing which states have a high percentage of mmr vaccination rates across different schools (such as Ohio), and states that have a low percentage (such as Florida). Though Ohio and Florida don’t show much variability across different schools, California does show a lot of variability. Overall, this shows a general map of how mmr vaccination rates differ across different regions in the US.\nFigure 2 - The graph showing the average vaccination rates between private and public schools seems to show a higher average vaccination rate for public schools. This is possibly due to local government rules and control over public schools in which students may be mandated to get vaccinated. Whereas in private schools it may have been more up to choice and out of government control.\nFigure 3 - The data reported for Charter, Kindergarten and Private schools shows that for schools with no new enrollments the vaccination rates reported differ significantly. For public schools we see a little more diversity, but no strong correlation either. Public schools with 0 new enrollments may have high or even no vaccination rates reported, but generally we see that a high enrollment rate rarely leads to low vaccination rates (this also applies to Charter, Kindergarten, and private schools). This visualization answers the question on whether or not enrollment numbers has an effect on vaccination rates, for which it was determined, enrollment rate is not a determining factor.\nFigure 4 - To explore if there is a relationship between urban and rural status and MMR vaccination rate, first, the states with the highest (Massachusetts, Illinois, and Pennsylvania) and lowest (Arkansas, Washington, and Minnesota) mean MMR vaccination rates were plotted. On its own this does not display any relation of urban or rural status to percentage of MMR vaccination rates, so information, provided by Iowa State University, on the 2010 U.S. Decennial Cenus was referenced [1]. The percentage of the total population in urban areas per each state was found: Massachusetts (92%), Illinois (88.5%), Pennsylvania (78.7%), Arkansas (56.2%), Washington (84.1%), and Minnesota (73.3%). There appears to be a weak correlation between urban/rural status of each state and MMR vaccination rate, but to a slight degree there is a trend. For instance, the state with the most drastic difference in mean MMR vaccination rate is Arkansas (80.49%) when compared to states with the highest mean MMR vaccination rates (>95%). Relatedly, Arkansas also has a significantly lower percentage of the total population in urban areas. States like Massachusetts and Illinois hold comparably higher percentages of the total population in urban areas and hold the highest mean MMR vaccination rates, 97.04% & 97.39%, respectively. However, states like Washington weaken the correlation by having a high percentage of the total population in urban areas, but reporting a comparably low mean MMR vaccination rate (89.3%).\nFull disclosure: The first visualization has “eval: FALSE” to facilitate pushing and pulling on GitHub (leaflet takes up a lot of space)."

These reports include the type of mistreatment, demographic & geographic information, etc.\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nThe observations included in this data set are state, year, type of report (fatalities, child victim), measure (i.e. the way data was measured: rate of child fatalities per 1000, number of reports), characteristic label (how it was filed, where it was reported), and value (number of children/cases). Additionally, within the dataset a lot of these observations are divided so that within one you can create many observations. For example, under type of report, each has its own values, state, characteristic (perhaps this table needs a pivot longer change)."

However, one per data set is required.)\nSince most reports were filed in 2015: Is there correlation between the type of report filed and the state in which it was reported in? Do the measures agree (i.e., does the rate of child fatalities per 1000 show a positive correlation if the number of reports per state shows a positive correlation)? This question is important because child neglect and abuse is immensely prevalent in the United States, and perhaps understanding in what states this is most common, we could narrow down a solution to diminishing child neglect in America. There really is no target audience, considering that this analysis affects all.\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nThe hypothesis of this question would be that there is a correlation between the type of report filed and state, and specifically that Florida would have the highest number of reported cases of child fatalities (the assumption that rate and number of reports both show similar results will be held). The research topic would also include a comparison between the type of measure (rate of child fatalities versus the number of reports) and identify whether these data agree with one another.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question.
