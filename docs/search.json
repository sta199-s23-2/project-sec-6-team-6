    "text": "Introduction and Data\nMotivation and Context\nThe motivation for this project stemmed from the measles dataset from tidytuesday. It was interesting to see how the data set categorically characterized the data. Our team imported the data into R and used the categories as a guide to make our plots and questions. The data as reported in the Wall Street Journal presents a map of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates in schools across the United States, showing that some schools have dangerously low MMR vaccination rates, which increases the risk of measles outbreaks. The data is based on information from the 2018-2019 school year and includes public, private, and charter schools. According to the map, many of the schools with the lowest vaccination rates are in states such as Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and Oregon. The article also notes that measles cases have been on the rise in recent years, and emphasizes the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the highly contagious virus. Through this narrative and viewing the raw data we were able to form our hypothesis and question.\nResearch question: Are schools’ vaccination rates influence by the type of school, state it’s located in, and it’s enrollment numbers? If so, can valid predictions on vaccination rates be made from these variables?\nHypothesis: It is expected that private schools with higher enrollment numbers will have higher rates of MMR vaccination. It is also expected that states with a high concentration of these schools will have higher vaccination rates.\nThe Data:\nQuantitative - vaccination rates\nCategorical - private or public and county and state levels"

    "text": "Results\nFigure 1 - This visualization answers the 1st research question by showing which states have a high percentage of mmr vaccination rates across different schools (such as Ohio), and states that have a low percentage (such as Florida). Though Ohio and Florida don’t show much variability across different schools, California does show a lot of variability. Overall, this shows a general map of how mmr vaccination rates differ across different regions in the US.\nFigure 2 - To explore if there is a relationship between urban and rural status and MMR vaccination rate, first, the states with the highest (Massachusetts, Illinois, and Pennsylvania) and lowest (Arkansas, Washington, and Minnesota) mean MMR vaccination rates were plotted. On its own this does not display any relation of urban or rural status to percentage of MMR vaccination rates, so information, provided by Iowa State University, on the 2010 U.S. Decennial Cenus was referenced \\(^1\\). The percentage of the total population in urban areas per each state was found: Massachusetts (92%), Illinois (88.5%), Pennsylvania (78.7%), Arkansas (56.2%), Washington (84.1%), and Minnesota (73.3%). There appears to be a weak correlation between urban/rural status of each state and MMR vaccination rate, but to a slight degree there is a trend. For instance, the state with the most drastic difference in mean MMR vaccination rate is Arkansas (80.49%) when compared to states with the highest mean MMR vaccination rates (>95%). Relatedly, Arkansas also has a significantly lower percentage of the total population in urban areas. States like Massachusetts and Illinois hold comparably higher percentages of the total population in urban areas and hold the highest mean MMR vaccination rates, 97.04% & 97.39%, respectively. However, states like Washington weaken the correlation by having a high percentage of the total population in urban areas, but reporting a comparably low mean MMR vaccination rate (89.3%).\nFigure 3 - The data reported for maximum and minimum average vaccination rate by county in each state showed that most states had a maximum vaccination rate of 99 or 100%. On the other hand, minimum vaccination rates ranged from 1% to 96%. States often had several counties tied at the maximum. One noteworthy finding is that California had several counties all at 99, which is odd. It’s very likely that some of the data was influenced by the removal of NA values, and there was also one minimum school missing its County in Missouri.\nFigure 4 - The data reported for Charter, Kindergarten and Private schools shows that for schools with no new enrollments the vaccination rates reported differ significantly. For public schools we see a little more diversity, but no strong correlation either. Public schools with 0 new enrollments may have high or even no vaccination rates reported, but generally we see that a high enrollment rate rarely leads to low vaccination rates (this also applies to Charter, Kindergarten, and private schools). This visualization answers the question on whether or not enrollment numbers has an effect on vaccination rates, for which it was determined, enrollment rate is not a determining factor.\nFigure 5 - The graph showing the average vaccination rates between private and public schools seems to show a higher average vaccination rate for public schools. This is possibly due to local government rules and control over public schools in which students may be mandated to get vaccinated. Whereas in private schools it may have been more up to choice and out of government control. The resulting hypothesis test showed that there is a significant difference in vaccination rate between public schools and private school (p<.05). This number may not be wholly accurate due to the removal of much private school data, but we assume the difference can be attributed to a lack of vaccine mandate within private schools.\nThe additive model yielded an adjusted r-square value of 0.243 using the type, enroll, and state variables. This was a considerably lower adjusted r-squared value than the interactive model which yielded an adjusted-r-squared of 0.47. Therefore, we continued using the interactive model as a framework for testing the predictability of other variables. We proceeded to test the predictability of enrollment and and type through constructing two separate models with one being state and enroll and the other being state and type. We found that the model with state and enroll had a far higher adjusted-r-squared of 0.87 compared to the other model’s adjusted r-squared of 0.34. Despite the higher adjusted r squared, our question evaluated whether state, enrollment number, and type of school would be good predictors, so we chose the original interactive model for the prediction. We were not really quite sure why this occurred however it was an interesting finding that warrants further investigation in future studies."

However, one per data set is required.)\nSince most reports were filed in 2015: Is there correlation between the type of report filed and the state in which it was reported in? Do the measures agree (i.e., does the rate of child fatalities per 1000 show a positive correlation if the number of reports per state shows a positive correlation)? This question is important because child neglect and abuse is immensely prevalent in the United States, and perhaps understanding in what states this is most common, we could narrow down a solution to diminishing child neglect in America. There really is no target audience, considering that this analysis affects all.\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nThe hypothesis of this question would be that there is a correlation between the type of report filed and state, and specifically that Florida would have the highest number of reported cases of child fatalities (the assumption that rate and number of reports both show similar results will be held). The research topic would also include a comparison between the type of measure (rate of child fatalities versus the number of reports) and identify whether these data agree with one another.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nType of report filed: categorical\nState: categorical\nMeasure: Quantitative"

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nSummary: From our analyses, we learned that whether students attend a private or public school DOES affect, at least to some extent, how high vaccination rates are. In addition, and in answer to our research questions, state, type of school, and enrollment number provide good predictions on the vaccination rates reported - with enrollment and state being the best predictors. In essence, all our factors influence schools’ vaccination rates.\nEthical considerations: Vaccination data is listed under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as protected health information and therefore cannot be shared without patient consent. In certain areas, vaccine data is not required for schools as well. The data may also be used to discriminate against certain areas unjustly. The US does not all benefit equally from our research. Some areas may so be more or less receptive to revealing their vaccination information so the study may not impact our target population equally.\nLimitations: We saw negative values in the dataset, but we don’t know exactly what it means - we speculate that perhaps these suggest that the schools did/do not report vaccination rates.\nSome states do not require schools to report MMR vaccination data, thus resulting in a lack of information for a few states. This results in inconclusive data from those states, and they will not be considered for this research analysis.\nWhile our research question seeks to understand the influence of geographic region status (urban vs rural), the dataset collected does not contain information on the geographic status where each school is located. While we pooled external information drawn from the 2010 US Decennial Census, the analysis derived might not accurately reflect the relationship between these two variables.\nFuture work: Our study had a very defined scope. However, future work could include observing vaccination rates in different states or outside of the US. Additionally, testing other variables in anticipation of yielding a stronger predictive model could be another route. Last but not least, this data relies mostly on reported vaccination rates from 2018-19, so other (perhaps more current) years should be considered to reach thorough conclusions. Perhaps comparing this data with measles outbreak or cases, would be an interesting route to understand the effect that vaccination rates in schools have on measles cases.\n##References\n\nMoriarty, D., Umlauf, T., & Abbott, B.

To prevent another pandemic, and for the health of our future generations, it is of essence to understand why measles cases have been on the rise and how to prevent it. Vaccinations, as we all know, are low-risk preventors of outbreaks as these, so we analyzed different factors that increase/decrease vaccination rates across the US. In this paper, the type of school (public v. private), state the school is located in, as well as enrollment numbers for that school were all considered. Through linear regression models, and a hypothesis test, it was identified that all these variables influence vaccination rates in school - with the best predictors being enrollment numbers and the state the school is located in."
